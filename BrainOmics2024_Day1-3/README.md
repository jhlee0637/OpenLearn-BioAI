## BrainOmics2024: Single-cell & Spatial Transcriptomics Analysis Hands-on
[한국어](./README_kor.md)
### Abstract
This repository was created as part of the activities of a bioinformatics study group.    
Based on the practical sessions of the [Brain Omics 2024 Course](https://github.com/BrainOmicsCourse/BrainOmics2024), held in 2024 at the Human Technopole in Milan, Italy, this repository focuses on reconstructing and implementing the course materials.

### Objectives
- To gain a complete understanding of the scRNA-seq analysis pipeline through detailed code comments.
- To learn methodologies for spatial transcriptomics data analysis.
- To process bioinformatics data using pandas, numpy, and scanpy.
- To apply dimensionality reduction using PCA and UMAP, and learn advanced visualization techniques.

### Day 0: Environment Setup
- Conda environment setup
- AnnData object optimization
- Jupyter Notebook setup

### [Day 1: Basic Single-cell RNA-seq Analysis](./Day1/1_DataAnalysis_execution.ipynb)
- The entire workflow from count matrix to clusters.
- Data filtering, normalization, and batch effect removal.
- Cluster characterization and marker gene discovery.

### Day 2: Advanced Single-cell Analysis
- Multiplet detection and removal
- Metacell creation
- Trajectory inference
- Transcription factor activity prediction
