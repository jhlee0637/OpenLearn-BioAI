### Bionformatics is the OPEN SCIENCE.
There are bunch of (AI related) bioinformatics resources you can find from the internet.    
So many tools, pipelines, tutorials to study, practice, and utilize.    

But to be fair, a lot of good resources has the critical probelm - data is missing.    
The reason could be
1) The data is too big
2) The data is too private
3) They just don't want to share it

So here, I am gathering & *re-creating* Bioinformaitcs hands-on practices with *public* dataset which helps you to download, run, and analyze to boost your bioinformatics experience.
