## Project Overview
### Bionformatics is the OPEN SCIENCE.
The internet is filled with bioinformatics resources - tools, pipelines, and tutorials for studying, practicing, and utilizing computational biology. But here's the **problem**: most of these valuable resources have a critical flaw - **the data is missing**.     

Why are datasets often unavailable?
1. **The data is too big** - Multi-terabyte genomic datasets exceed typical storage
2. **The data is too private** - Clinical and sensitive biological information
3. **They just don't want to share it** - Proprietary or competitive restrictions

So here, I'm **gathering and re-creating** bioinformatics hands-on practices with **public datasets** that you can actually download, run, and analyze. This project bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation, boosting your real-world bioinformatics experience.
